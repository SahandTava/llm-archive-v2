          "text": "Yes, Selenium is a good choice for JavaScript-rendered content! However, I'd actually recommend considering **Playwright** as a modern alternative. Here's why:\n\n**Playwright advantages:**\n- Faster execution\n- Better API design\n- Built-in waiting strategies\n- Supports multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)\n\nHere's a quick example:\n\n```python\nfrom playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright\n\nwith sync_playwright() as p:\n    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True)\n    page = browser.new_page()\n    page.goto('https://example.com')\n    \n    # Wait for dynamic content\n    page.wait_for_selector('.dynamic-content')\n    \n    # Extract text\n    content = page.query_selector('.dynamic-content').inner_text()\n    \n    browser.close()\n```\n\nBut if you prefer Selenium (more tutorials available):\n\n```python\nfrom selenium import webdriver\nfrom selenium.webdriver.common.by import By\nfrom selenium.webdriver.support.wait import WebDriverWait\nfrom selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC\n\ndriver = webdriver.Chrome()\ndriver.get('https://example.com')\n\n# Wait for element\nelement = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(\n    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, 'dynamic-content'))\n)\n\ndriver.quit()\n```\n\nWhich would you like to try?",

          "text": "I can help optimize this query! The main issue is likely the `LEFT JOIN` combined with the `WHERE` clause on the joined table, which essentially converts it to an `INNER JOIN` but less efficiently. Here are several optimization strategies:\n\n**1. Fix the JOIN logic:**\n```sql\nSELECT u.name, COUNT(o.id) as order_count\nFROM users u\nINNER JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id\nWHERE o.created_at > '2024-01-01'\nGROUP BY u.id, u.name  -- Group by ID for better performance\nORDER BY order_count DESC;\n```\n\n**2. Add indexes:**\n```sql\n-- Composite index for the JOIN and WHERE\nCREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_created ON orders(user_id, created_at);\n\n-- If not already present\nCREATE INDEX idx_users_id ON users(id);\n```\n\n**3. If you really need ALL users (even with 0 orders):**\n```sql\nSELECT \n    u.name, \n    COALESCE(o.order_count, 0) as order_count\nFROM users u\nLEFT JOIN (\n    SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) as order_count\n    FROM orders\n    WHERE created_at > '2024-01-01'\n    GROUP BY user_id\n) o ON u.id = o.user_id\nORDER BY order_count DESC;\n```\n\n**4. Analyze the query plan:**\n```sql\nEXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) \n-- your query here\n```\n\nThis will show you exactly where the bottleneck is. Can you run the EXPLAIN and share the output?",
